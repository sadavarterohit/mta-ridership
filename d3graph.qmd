This graph shows the monthly ridership of the 6 most frequently used subway stations by weekday and weekend, dynamically updating by month. This is another way to visualize the last line graph of the previous section. It is apparent that the relative lengths of the bars remain almost unchanged during different months, which correspond to the trends observed in the line graph (ridership appears to increase and decrease uniformly across the entire subway system). Also, notice that there is an overall increase in the bar lengths from 2020 to 2024, which corresponds to the steady increase in ridership visible in the line graph (ridership was lower than usual during the time of the pandemic, and then steadily increased afterwards).
