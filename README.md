In this project, our aim is to analyze how MTA delays and service alerts on the NYC subway impact the wait time and ridership on different subway lines, using data from <https://data.ny.gov/>.

The subway is the heart and soul of NYC, and the delays have become part of dealing with the subway on an everday basis. Is this normalisation okay? We don't think so, a good first step is to find the pattern in the delays in these lines.
